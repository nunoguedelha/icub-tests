If you have not installed R\-T\-F, Please see \href{http://robotology.github.io/robot-testing/index.html}{\tt http\-://robotology.\-github.\-io/robot-\/testing/index.\-html} . Note that {\ttfamily icub-\/tests} use the Y\-A\-R\-P support in R\-T\-F, so please check that R\-T\-F is compiled with the {\ttfamily E\-N\-A\-B\-L\-E\-\_\-\-M\-I\-D\-D\-L\-E\-W\-A\-R\-E\-\_\-\-P\-L\-U\-G\-I\-N\-S} C\-Make option setted to O\-N. You should also make sure that the yarpmanager plugin generated by R\-T\-F can be found by the testrunner. For more info on how to install R\-T\-F with Y\-A\-R\-P support, please check the https\-://github.com/robotology/robot-\/testing/blob/master/doc/yarp\-\_\-configuration.\-md \char`\"{}\-Y\-A\-R\-P support documentation on R\-T\-F\char`\"{} .\hypertarget{installation_building_tests}{}\section{Building tests}\label{installation_building_tests}
On Linux machines, open a terminal and type\-: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ git clone https:\textcolor{comment}{//github.com/robotology/icub-tests.git}
$ cd icub-tests; 
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ../; make
\end{DoxyCode}


On windows machines use the C\-Make program to create Visual Studio project and build it.

Note\-: in case C\-Make fails to detect the R\-T\-F package check that you installed R\-T\-F or that you set the R\-T\-F\-\_\-\-D\-I\-R environment variables to point to the build directory. Also check that R\-T\-F was compiled with Y\-A\-R\-P support enables (set {\ttfamily E\-N\-A\-B\-L\-E\-\_\-\-M\-I\-D\-D\-L\-E\-W\-A\-R\-E\-\_\-\-P\-L\-U\-G\-I\-N\-S} and verify that {\ttfamily E\-N\-A\-B\-L\-E\-\_\-\-Y\-A\-R\-P} is O\-N).\hypertarget{installation_soncifugration}{}\section{Configuration}\label{installation_soncifugration}
Test cases are built as R\-T\-F plug-\/ins (shared libraries) and can be found in {\ttfamily icub-\/tests/build/plugins} folder. We need to add the plug-\/ins path to the platform library environment variable (i.\-e., {\ttfamily L\-D\-\_\-\-L\-I\-B\-R\-A\-R\-Y\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H} on Linux machine).


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ echo \textcolor{stringliteral}{'export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:<path to icub\_tests/build/plugins>'} >> ~/.bashrc
\end{DoxyCode}


Tests configuration (.ini files) can be found in {\ttfamily icub-\/tests/suit/contexts}. We need to configure {\ttfamily Y\-A\-R\-P\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-D\-I\-R\-S} environment variable so that the test cases can load the configuration files.


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ echo \textcolor{stringliteral}{'export YARP\_DATA\_DIRS=$YARP\_DATA\_DIRS:<path to icub-tests/suits>'} >> ~/.bashrc
\end{DoxyCode}
